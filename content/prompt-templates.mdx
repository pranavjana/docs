# Prompt Templates

This page contains ready-to-use goal templates for common automation patterns. Copy, customize, and use.

## The Canonical Template

Every Mino goal should follow this structure:

```
[ACTION] [WHAT] from [WHERE] and return as [FORMAT]
```

Examples:
- "Extract product names, prices, and stock status from the product grid and return as JSON"
- "Fill the contact form with provided details and submit, then return the confirmation number"
- "Navigate to each product page, extract specifications, and return all data as a list"

## Short Form Templates

### Simple Extraction

```
Extract [data points] from [page element/section]
```

Examples:
```
Extract product name, price, and rating from the product card
```

```
Extract all article titles and publication dates from the news feed
```

```
Extract company name, location, and phone number from the contact section
```

### Single Action

```
Click [button/element description]
```

Examples:
```
Click the "Add to Cart" button
```

```
Click the blue "Submit" button at the bottom of the form
```

### Form Fill

```
Fill [field name] with "[value]"
```

Examples:
```
Fill the email field with "test@example.com"
```

```
Fill "First Name" with "John" and "Last Name" with "Doe"
```

## Long Form Templates

### Multi-Step Workflow

```
1. [First action]
2. [Second action]
3. [Third action]
4. Extract [data] and return as [format]
```

Example:
```
1. Click the "Login" button in the header
2. Fill username with "user@example.com"
3. Fill password with "password123"
4. Click the "Sign In" button
5. Wait for the dashboard to load
6. Extract account balance and recent transactions
```

### Pagination Pattern

```
Navigate through [number] pages by clicking [pagination element],
extracting [data] from each page. Return all results combined.
```

Example:
```
Navigate through 5 pages by clicking the "Next" button,
extracting product name, price, and URL from each listing.
Return all results combined as a single array.
```

### Conditional Logic

```
If [condition], then [action A], otherwise [action B].
Then extract [data].
```

Example:
```
If a cookie consent popup appears, click "Accept All".
Then extract all product names and prices from the page.
```

## API Request Examples

### Basic with Template

```typescript
const response = await fetch("https://mino.ai/v1/automation/run-sse", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "X-API-Key": process.env.MINO_API_KEY!,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: "https://example.com/products",
    goal: `For each product on this page, extract:

  browser_profile: "stealth",
  proxy_config: {
    enabled: true,
    country_code: "US",
  },
}),
```

## Tips for Writing Goals

- **Be Specific**: "Extract product name" beats "get data"
- **Be Visual**: "Click the blue button in the top right" helps the AI locate elements
- **Number Steps**: Makes multi-step workflows clear and traceable
- **Specify Format**: "Return as JSON array" ensures structured output
- **Handle Edge Cases**: "If popup appears, close it first" prevents failures
