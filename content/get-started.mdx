# Get Started

This guide will help you understand what this documentation site provides and give you a checklist for building your first Mino use case.

## What This Site Is

This documentation site is a practical resource for Mino interns containing:

- **Prompt Templates** - Ready-to-use goal templates for common automation patterns
- **Workflow Playbook** - A systematic approach to building use cases
- **Best Practices** - Tips for writing effective goals and handling edge cases
- **Use Case Library** - Real examples from completed projects
- **FAQ** - Common errors and solutions

## What This Site Is NOT

- Not a replacement for the official [Mino API docs](https://docs.mino.ai)
- Not for MCP integration details (see official docs)
- Not for authentication/API key management

## New Use Case Checklist

Before starting a new use case, work through this checklist:

### 1. Define the Goal
- [ ] What data do you need to extract?
- [ ] What actions need to be performed?
- [ ] Is there pagination or multiple pages?
- [ ] Are there login/authentication requirements?

### 2. Identify the Target Site
- [ ] Is the URL stable and public?
- [ ] Does the site have bot protection (Cloudflare, CAPTCHAs)?
- [ ] Does the site require geographic location for access?
- [ ] Is the content loaded dynamically (JavaScript)?

### 3. Choose Browser Profile
- [ ] **lite** (default) - For standard sites without bot protection
- [ ] **stealth** - For sites with bot detection, CAPTCHAs, or Cloudflare

### 4. Determine Proxy Needs
- [ ] Is the content geo-restricted?
- [ ] Are you getting "Access Denied" errors?
- [ ] If yes, which country code is needed? (US, GB, CA, DE, FR, JP, AU)

### 5. Write Your Goal
- [ ] Be specific and actionable
- [ ] Number steps if multi-step workflow
- [ ] Describe UI elements visually when helpful
- [ ] Specify wait times for slow content if needed

### 6. Test and Iterate
- [ ] Run initial request
- [ ] Check `streamingUrl` to watch browser behavior
- [ ] Refine goal based on results
- [ ] Handle edge cases

## Quick Start Code

Here's the minimal code to test a Mino request:

```typescript
const response = await fetch("https://mino.ai/v1/automation/run-sse", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "X-API-Key": process.env.MINO_API_KEY!,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: "https://scrapeme.live/shop",
    goal: "Extract the first 3 product names and their prices",
  }),
});

// Parse SSE response
const reader = response.body!.getReader();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();
let buffer = "";

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;

  buffer += decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });
  const lines = buffer.split("\n");
  buffer = lines.pop() ?? "";

  for (const line of lines) {
    if (line.startsWith("data: ")) {
      const event = JSON.parse(line.slice(6));
      if (event.type === "COMPLETE" && event.status === "COMPLETED") {
        console.log("Result:", event.resultJson);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Expected Timing

| Task Type | Expected Time |
|-----------|---------------|
| Simple extraction | 3-10 seconds |
| Multi-step automation | 30-60 seconds |
| Complex with stealth | 1-2 minutes |

## Next Steps

1. Review [Prompt Templates](/prompt-templates) for ready-to-use patterns
2. Read the [Workflow Playbook](/workflow-playbook) for a systematic approach
3. Check the [Use Case Library](/use-case-library) for real examples
