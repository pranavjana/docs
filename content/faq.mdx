Common questions, errors, and their solutions.

## Common Errors

### Error: "Access Denied" or 403

**Cause**: Bot detection triggered by the target site.

**Solutions**:
1. Switch to stealth mode:
   ```typescript
   browser_profile: "stealth"
   ```

2. Add a proxy:
   ```typescript
   proxy_config: { enabled: true, country_code: "US" }
   ```

3. Both together (most robust):
   ```typescript
   browser_profile: "stealth",
   proxy_config: { enabled: true, country_code: "US" }
   ```

### Error: Timeout / Request Timed Out

**Cause**: Page loads slowly, or automation took too long.

**Solutions**:
1. Add explicit waits to your goal:
   ```
   Wait 5 seconds for the page to load, then extract...
   ```

2. Simplify the goal - break into multiple requests

3. Try stealth mode (some sites throttle suspicious connections)

4. Check if the site is actually accessible (try in browser)

### Error: Empty Results

**Cause**: Element not found, or content loaded dynamically.

**Solutions**:
1. Watch the streamingUrl to see what's happening
2. Add wait time for dynamic content:
   ```
   Wait for the product grid to load, then extract...
   ```
3. Use visual descriptions:
   ```
   Extract from the section with the heading "Products"
   ```
4. Check if content requires login or is geo-restricted

### Error: Partial Results

**Cause**: Only some data extracted, pagination not handled.

**Solutions**:
1. Explicitly request pagination in goal:
   ```
   Navigate through 5 pages, extracting all products from each
   ```
2. Handle "Load More" buttons:
   ```
   Click "Load More" 3 times, then extract all visible items
   ```
3. Check streamingUrl to see if all content is visible

### Error: Wrong Element Clicked

**Cause**: Goal description matches multiple elements.

**Solutions**:
1. Be more specific with visual descriptions:
   ```
   // Instead of:
   Click the Submit button

   // Use:
   Click the green "Submit" button at the bottom of the form
   ```

2. Add context about location:
   ```
   In the checkout section, click the "Place Order" button
   ```

### Error: CAPTCHA Challenge

**Cause**: Site requires human verification.

**Solutions**:
1. Use stealth mode (helps avoid triggering CAPTCHA)
2. Add proxy (different IP may not trigger CAPTCHA)
3. If CAPTCHA persists, the site may not be automatable without additional tools

## General Questions

### Q: When should I use stealth mode?

**A**: Use stealth mode when:
- Site shows CAPTCHA
- Getting "Access Denied" errors
- Site uses Cloudflare, DataDome, or similar protection
- Site loads but automation fails mysteriously

Default to `lite` mode first (faster), escalate to `stealth` if needed.

### Q: Which proxy country code should I use?

**A**:
| Country Code | Use For |
|--------------|---------|
| US | US-focused sites, financial sites, e-commerce |
| GB | UK sites, European alternatives |
| CA | Canadian content |
| DE | German/EU sites |
| FR | French sites |
| JP | Japanese sites |
| AU | Australian sites |

Default to `US` unless you specifically need content from another region.

### Q: How do I handle login-required pages?

**A**: Include login steps in your goal:

```typescript
goal: `
1. Fill the email field with "user@example.com"
2. Fill the password field with "password123"
3. Click the "Login" button
4. Wait for dashboard to load
5. Extract the account balance
`
```

For sensitive credentials, use environment variables:
```typescript
goal: `Login with email "${process.env.TEST_EMAIL}" and password "${process.env.TEST_PASSWORD}"`
```

### Q: How long do automations take?

**A**:
| Type | Expected Time |
|------|---------------|
| Simple extraction (lite) | 3-10 seconds |
| Multi-step workflow | 30-60 seconds |
| Complex with stealth | 1-2 minutes |
| With pagination (5+ pages) | 2-5 minutes |

If exceeding these times significantly, check streamingUrl for issues.

### Q: What's the rate limit?

**A**: Check your API plan. For development:
- Space requests by 2-3 seconds when testing repeatedly
- Use parallel requests carefully (may trigger rate limits)
- Monitor for 429 errors

---

### Q: Can I automate sites that require JavaScript?

**A**: Yes. Mino uses a real browser, so JavaScript-rendered content is fully supported. Just add wait time if content loads asynchronously:

```
Wait for the content to load, then extract...
```

### Q: How do I debug a failing automation?

**A**: Follow this process:

1. **Check streamingUrl** - Watch the browser in real-time
2. **Simplify the goal** - Reduce to the minimum failing case
3. **Try stealth mode** - Rule out bot detection
4. **Check the URL** - Make sure it's correct and accessible
5. **Read the full response** - Error messages often contain clues

See [QoL Tips](/qol-tips) for more debugging strategies.

### Q: Can I extract images?

**A**: Yes. Ask for image URLs in your goal:

```
Extract product name and image URL for each product
```

The URLs can then be downloaded separately if needed.

---

### Q: How do I handle infinite scroll pages?

**A**: Include scroll instructions in your goal:

```
Scroll down 5 times, waiting 2 seconds between each scroll.
Then extract all visible items.
```

---

### Q: What's the maximum response size?

**A**: Results are returned as JSON. For very large extractions:
- Break into multiple pages/requests
- Process and store incrementally
- Use pagination instead of extracting everything at once

## Troubleshooting Checklist

When stuck, go through this checklist:

- [ ] Is the URL correct and accessible in a normal browser?
- [ ] Did you check the streamingUrl?
- [ ] Is the goal specific enough?
- [ ] Have you tried stealth mode?
- [ ] Have you tried adding a proxy?
- [ ] Is there dynamic content that needs wait time?
- [ ] Are there popups that need to be handled?
- [ ] Is the site geo-restricted?
- [ ] Did you check for rate limiting?
- [ ] Have you simplified the goal to isolate the issue?
