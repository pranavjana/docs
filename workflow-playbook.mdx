## The 5-Phase Workflow

```
Define → Research → Configure → Build → Iterate
```

---

## Phase 1: Define

Before writing code, answer these questions:

| Question | Example |
|----------|---------|
| What's the end result? | JSON with product data |
| What are the inputs? | Category filter, URL |
| What are the constraints? | Geo-restricted to US |

**Example Definition:**
```
Use Case: Credit Card Comparison
Goal: Extract offers from 6 financial sites
Output: JSON with card name, APR, fee, rewards
Constraints: Some sites US-only
```

---

## Phase 2: Research

Manually explore each target site before automating.

### Site Analysis Checklist

For each site, document:

- **URL Structure** - Stable? Changes with filters?
- **Bot Protection** - Cloudflare? CAPTCHA?
- **Content Loading** - Static HTML or JavaScript?
- **Pagination** - Infinite scroll? Page numbers? Load more?
- **Authentication** - Login required?
- **Geo Restrictions** - US-only? Region-locked?

**Example:**
```
Site: example-bank.com
URL: https://example-bank.com/credit-cards
Protection: Cloudflare (needs stealth)
Content: JS-rendered, loads in 2-3s
Pagination: "Load More" button
Auth: Not required
Geo: US-only (needs proxy)
```

---

## Phase 3: Configure

### Browser Profile

```
Site has bot protection?
├─ Yes → "stealth"
└─ No → "lite" (default)
```

### Proxy

```
Content geo-restricted?
├─ Yes → Enable proxy
└─ No → Skip proxy
```

### Configuration Template

```typescript
const config = {
  url: "https://target-site.com/page",
  goal: "...",

  // Add only if needed:
  browser_profile: "stealth",
  proxy_config: { enabled: true, country_code: "US" },
};
```

---

## Phase 4: Build

Start simple, then add complexity:

**Step 1 - Basic:**
```
Extract the first product name
```

**Step 2 - More data:**
```
Extract product name, price, and rating
```

**Step 3 - All items:**
```
Extract product name, price, and rating for all products on this page
```

**Step 4 - Structured:**
```
For each product on this page, extract:
- name
- price
- rating
- url

Return as JSON array
```

**Step 5 - Handle edge cases:**
```
If a cookie consent popup appears, click "Accept".

For each product on this page, extract:
- name
- price
- rating
- url

Return as JSON array
```

---

## Phase 5: Iterate

### Use streamingUrl

Every response includes a `streamingUrl` to watch the browser live:

```typescript
if (event.streamingUrl) {
  console.log("Watch live:", event.streamingUrl);
}
```

### Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Empty results | Element not found | Watch streamingUrl, adjust goal |
| Timeout | Page loads slowly | Add wait time |
| Access denied | Bot detection | Use stealth mode |
| Partial data | Pagination missed | Add pagination to goal |
| Wrong data | Ambiguous goal | Be more specific |

### Iteration Cycle

```
Run → Observe (streamingUrl) → Diagnose → Refine → Run
```

### Refinement Examples

**Too vague → Specific:**
```
// Before: "Get the data from the page"
// After: "Extract the product table showing name, price, and availability"
```

**Element not found → Visual description:**
```
// Before: "Click the Submit button"
// After: "Click the green Submit button at the bottom right of the form"
```

**Timing issue → Add wait:**
```
// Before: "Extract search results"
// After: "Wait 3 seconds for results to load, then extract search results"
```

## Complete Example

### 1. Define
```
Goal: Extract job listings from LinkedIn
Data: Job title, company, location, date, URL
Constraint: Needs login, geo-restricted
```

### 2. Research
```
URL: linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=...
Protection: Heavy bot detection
Content: Dynamic JavaScript
Auth: Required
Geo: Results vary by region
```

### 3. Configure
```typescript
const config = {
  url: "https://linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=software+engineer",
  browser_profile: "stealth",
  proxy_config: { enabled: true, country_code: "US" },
};
```

### 4. Build
```typescript
const goal = `
1. If login prompt appears, enter email and password
2. Wait for job listings to load
3. For each job listing, extract:
   - Job title
   - Company name
   - Location
   - Posting date
   - Job URL
4. Return as JSON array
`;
```

### 5. Iterate
- Watch streamingUrl to verify login
- Adjust wait times if content loads slowly
- Refine descriptions if extraction misses items
- Handle popups or modals
