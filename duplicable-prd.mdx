Once your use case is working, create documentation so others can understand and replicate it. Use the following prompt with your vibe coding tool (Claude, Cursor, etc.) to generate a standard developer document.

## PRD Generation Prompt

Copy and send this prompt to generate documentation for your completed use case:

<Accordion title="Click to expand the PRD Generation Prompt">

```
Please generate a **standard developer documentation example** for the **Mino API use case** I've developed.

1. **Product Architecture Overview**
   - Describe the overall system architecture in simple terms
   - Explain which APIs are being called
   - Clarify the relationship between each API
   - Specify how many times each API is called
   - Explain how these API calls are orchestrated and connected together

2. **Code Snippet**
   - Provide a runnable example in a relevant tech stack (cURL, TypeScript, or Python)
   - Show how the Mino API is invoked within the flow

3. **Goal (Prompt)**
   - Include the exact natural language prompt sent to the Mino API
   - Clearly format and label this prompt so readers understand the intent

4. **Sample Output**
   - Provide a simulated streaming JSON response returned by the Mino API
   - Show how the output would look in practice

Please organize everything clearly so that a developer who has never seen this
project before can quickly understand how it works end to end.

## Why Create a PRD?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Knowledge Transfer" icon="book-open">
    Others can understand your work without asking you
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reusability" icon="recycle">
    Similar use cases can build on your foundation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Portfolio" icon="briefcase">
    Document your contributions for performance reviews
  </Card>
  <Card title="Debugging" icon="bug">
    Future maintainers can understand the original intent
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## PRD Checklist

After generating, verify your PRD includes:

<Checklist>
  - Clear architecture diagram or description
  - Working code example (tested and runnable)
  - The exact Mino goal/prompt used
  - Sample output showing what success looks like
  - Any gotchas or special configuration needed
</Checklist>

## Example PRD Structure

Here's what a good PRD looks like:

### 1. Architecture Overview

```
User Request
    ↓
Next.js API Route
    ↓
Mino API (run-sse endpoint)
    ↓
SSE Stream Processing
    ↓
JSON Response to Frontend
```

### 2. Code Snippet

```typescript
// API route: /api/scrape
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { url, category } = await req.json();

  const response = await fetch("https://mino.ai/v1/automation/run-sse", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "X-API-Key": process.env.MINO_API_KEY!,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      url,
      goal: `Extract all ${category} products with name, price, and rating`,
      browser_profile: "stealth",
    }),
  });

  // Process SSE stream...
}
```

### 3. Goal (Prompt)

```
Extract all travel credit cards from this page.
For each card, get:
- Card name
- Issuer bank
- Annual fee
- APR range
- Sign-up bonus
- Key rewards and benefits

Return as JSON array.
```

### 4. Sample Output

```json
{
  "type": "COMPLETE",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "resultJson": {
    "cards": [
      {
        "name": "Chase Sapphire Preferred",
        "issuer": "Chase",
        "annualFee": "$95",
        "apr": "21.49% - 28.49%",
        "signupBonus": "60,000 points",
        "benefits": ["2x on travel", "2x on dining", "No foreign transaction fees"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
