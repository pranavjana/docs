## Common Errors

### "Access Denied" or 403

**Cause**: Bot detection triggered.

**Fix**: Escalate your configuration:

```typescript
// Step 1: Add stealth mode
browser_profile: "stealth"

// Step 2: If still blocked, add proxy
browser_profile: "stealth",
proxy_config: { enabled: true, country_code: "US" }
```

---

### Timeout

**Cause**: Page loads slowly or automation took too long.

**Fix**:
1. Add explicit waits: `"Wait 5 seconds for the page to load, then extract..."`
2. Simplify the goal - break into multiple requests
3. Try stealth mode (some sites throttle suspicious connections)

---

### Empty Results

**Cause**: Element not found or content loaded dynamically.

**Fix**:
1. Watch the `streamingUrl` to see what's happening
2. Add wait time: `"Wait for the product grid to load, then extract..."`
3. Use visual descriptions: `"Extract from the section with heading 'Products'"`

---

### Partial Results

**Cause**: Pagination not handled.

**Fix**:
```
Navigate through 5 pages, extracting all products from each
```
Or for "Load More" buttons:
```
Click "Load More" 3 times, then extract all visible items
```

---

### Wrong Element Clicked

**Cause**: Ambiguous element description.

**Fix**: Be more specific:
```
// Instead of:
Click the Submit button

// Use:
Click the green "Submit" button at the bottom of the form
```

---

### CAPTCHA Challenge

**Cause**: Site requires human verification.

**Fix**:
1. Use stealth mode
2. Add proxy (different IP may not trigger CAPTCHA)
3. If CAPTCHA persists, the site may not be automatable

---

## Quick Reference

### When to Use Stealth Mode

Use `stealth` when:
- Site shows CAPTCHA
- Getting "Access Denied" errors
- Site uses Cloudflare or similar protection
- Automation fails mysteriously

Default to `lite` (faster), escalate to `stealth` if needed.

### Proxy Country Codes

| Code | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `US` | US sites, financial, e-commerce (default) |
| `GB` | UK sites |
| `CA` | Canadian content |
| `DE` | German/EU sites |
| `FR` | French sites |
| `JP` | Japanese sites |
| `AU` | Australian sites |

### Expected Timing

| Type | Time |
|------|------|
| Simple extraction (lite) | 3-10 seconds |
| Multi-step workflow | 30-60 seconds |
| Complex with stealth | 1-2 minutes |
| With pagination (5+ pages) | 2-5 minutes |

### Login-Required Pages

Include login steps in your goal:

```typescript
goal: `
1. Fill the email field with "user@example.com"
2. Fill the password field with "password123"
3. Click the "Login" button
4. Wait for dashboard to load
5. Extract the account balance
`
```

### Infinite Scroll

```
Scroll down 5 times, waiting 2 seconds between each scroll.
Then extract all visible items.
```

### JavaScript Sites

Mino uses a real browser - JS content is fully supported. Just add wait time:
```
Wait for the content to load, then extract...
```

## Debug Checklist

When stuck, verify:

1. Is the URL correct and accessible in a browser?
2. Did you check the `streamingUrl`?
3. Is the goal specific enough?
4. Have you tried stealth mode?
5. Have you tried adding a proxy?
6. Does dynamic content need wait time?
7. Are there popups that need handling?
8. Is the site geo-restricted?
