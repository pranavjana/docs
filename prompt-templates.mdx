## The Golden Rule

Every Mino goal should follow this structure:

```
[ACTION] [WHAT] from [WHERE] and return as [FORMAT]
```

**Examples:**
- "Extract product names, prices, and stock status from the product grid and return as JSON"
- "Fill the contact form with provided details and submit, then return the confirmation number"
